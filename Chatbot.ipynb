      "User asked: who is Thor?\n",
      "Bot: Thor is a prominent figure with two main interpretations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **In Norse Mythology (The Original):**\n",
      "    *   **God of Thunder:** Thor is one of the most powerful and well-known gods in the Norse pantheon. He is the god of thunder, lightning, storms, strength, oak trees, and the protection of mankind.\n",
      "    *   **Son of Odin:** He is the son of Odin (the Allfather) and Jörð (the personification of the Earth).\n",
      "    *   **Protector of Asgard and Midgard:** Thor is a fierce protector of Asgard (the realm of the gods) and Midgard (the realm of humans) from their enemies, primarily the Jötnar (giants).\n",
      "    *   **Mjolnir:** His most famous attribute is his enchanted hammer, **Mjolnir**, which can level mountains, return to his hand after being thrown, and only be wielded by those worthy. He also possesses a belt of strength (Megingjörð) and iron gloves (Járngreipr).\n",
      "    *   **Personality:** He is often depicted as boisterous, strong, courageous, and sometimes hot-headed, but ultimately noble and devoted to protecting the innocent.\n",
      "    *   **Ragnarok:** In the prophecy of Ragnarok (the end of the world), Thor is fated to slay the monstrous Midgard Serpent, Jörmungandr, but will die from its venom shortly after.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **In Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU):**\n",
      "    *   **Adapted from Mythology:** Marvel's Thor is an adaptation of the Norse mythological figure, reimagined as a superhero.\n",
      "    *   **Asgardian Prince/King:** He is the Prince (and later King) of Asgard, an advanced alien civilization that was worshiped as gods by ancient Earthlings.\n",

      "User asked: who is IronMan?\n",
      "Bot: Iron Man is one of the most iconic superheroes from Marvel Comics. Here's a breakdown of who he is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Secret Identity:** He is **Anthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark**, a brilliant, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and the CEO of Stark Industries (originally a weapons manufacturer).\n",
      "2.  **Origin Story:** Tony Stark was originally a weapons manufacturer who, during a business trip to Afghanistan (or Vietnam in earlier comics), was captured by terrorists/enemies. During his captivity, he was severely injured by a booby trap, leaving shrapnel near his heart. To survive and escape, he was forced to build a miniaturized arc reactor to power an electromagnet that kept the shrapnel from reaching his heart, and he secretly constructed a powerful, armored suit.\n",
      "3.  **Powers & Abilities:**\n",
      "    *   **Genius-Level Intellect:** Tony Stark's primary \"superpower\" is his unparalleled genius in engineering, physics, robotics, and computer science. He constantly invents and upgrades his technology.\n",

      "User asked: tell me about Covid Virus\n",
      "Bot: The COVID-19 virus, officially named **SARS-CoV-2** (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), is the pathogen responsible for the disease **COVID-19** (Coronavirus Disease 2019). It emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, leading to a global pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of key information about the COVID-19 virus:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **What is it?**\n",
      "    *   **Type:** It's a novel coronavirus, belonging to the family *Coronaviridae*. Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes (corona) on their surface, which they use to attach to and infect host cells.\n",
      "    *   **Genetic Material:** It's an RNA virus. Its genetic material is prone to mutations, leading to the emergence of new variants.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Origin and Transmission:**\n",
      "    *   **Origin:** The virus is believed to have originated in bats and then likely jumped to humans through an intermediate animal host, with the first known cases identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.\n",
      "    *   **How it Spreads:** Primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. These particles can be inhaled by others or land on surfaces that people then touch, transferring the virus to their eyes, nose, or mouth.\n",
      "        *   **Close Contact:** Most common during close, sustained contact (within 6 feet).\n",
      "        *   **Aerosol Transmission:** Smaller particles can linger in the air, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces, and travel further.\n",
      "        *   **Fomites:** While possible, transmission via contaminated surfaces (fomites) is considered less common than direct respiratory spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Symptoms of COVID-19 Disease:**\n",
      "    *   Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and some people can be asymptomatic (have no symptoms) yet still transmit the virus.\n",
      "    *   **Common Symptoms:** Fever or chills, cough (often dry), fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea.\n",
      "    *   **Distinctive Symptoms:** Loss of taste or smell (anosmia/ageusia) was a hallmark early in the pandemic, though less common with newer variants.\n",
      "    *   **Severe Symptoms:** Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, bluish lips or face. These require immediate medical attention.\n",
      "    *   **Incubation Period:** Typically 2-14 days after exposure, with symptoms often appearing around 5-6 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Severity and Risk Factors:**\n",
      "    *   The severity of COVID-19 varies greatly. Most people experience mild to moderate illness and recover.\n",
      "    *   **High-Risk Groups for Severe Disease:**\n",
      "        *   Older adults (risk increases significantly with age).\n",
      "        *   People with underlying medical conditions, including heart disease, lung disease (e.g., asthma, COPD), diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and weakened immune systems.\n",
      "        *   Pregnant individuals.\n",
      "    *   **Complications:** Severe cases can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), blood clots, stroke, heart damage, kidney injury, multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and long-term health issues (Long COVID).\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Diagnosis:**\n",
      "    *   **PCR Tests:** Polymerase Chain Reaction tests are highly accurate and detect the virus's genetic material.\n",
      "    *   **Antigen Tests:** Rapid tests that detect specific viral proteins. Less sensitive than PCR but provide quick results.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   There is no single \"cure\" for COVID-19, but treatments focus on managing symptoms and, for severe cases, reducing the viral load and inflammatory response.\n",
      "    *   **Mild Cases:** Rest, fluids, over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers.\n",
      "    *   **Moderate/Severe Cases:** Hospitalization, oxygen therapy, antiviral medications (e.g., Remdesivir, Paxlovid), anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., Dexamethasone), and in some cases, monoclonal antibodies (early in the disease course for specific patients).\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Prevention:**\n",
      "    *   **Vaccination:** Highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus.\n",
      "    *   **Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs):**\n",
      "        *   **Masking:** Wearing high-quality masks (N95, KN95) in crowded or poorly ventilated indoor settings.\n",
      "        *   **Physical Distancing:** Maintaining space between yourself and others.\n",
      "        *   **Hand Hygiene:** Frequent hand washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n",
      "        *   **Ventilation:** Improving airflow in indoor spaces.\n",
      "        *   **Testing and Isolation:** Getting tested if symptomatic or exposed, and isolating if positive to prevent further spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Variants:**\n",
      "    *   As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 constantly mutates. Some mutations lead to new \"variants\" that can be more transmissible, cause more severe disease, or evade immunity from previous infection or vaccination.\n",
      "    *   Notable variants include Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (with its numerous sub-variants like BA.5, XBB, JN.1, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "9.  **Long COVID (Post-COVID Conditions):**\n",
      "    *   Many individuals experience persistent or new symptoms weeks, months, or even years after their initial COVID-19 infection, regardless of initial severity.\n",
      "    *   Common symptoms include profound fatigue, \"brain fog,\" shortness of breath, heart palpitations, chronic pain, and sleep disturbances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented global impact, causing millions of deaths, overwhelming healthcare systems, disrupting economies, and changing social behaviors worldwide. While the global emergency phase has passed, the virus continues to circulate and evolve, making ongoing vigilance, vaccination, and public health measures important.\n",
